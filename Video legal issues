Video legal issues
* We'll need to adjust T&C to account for video
* Discrimination issues
-- Is there precedent for consent required to record/view video
-- Can users delete, edit, control sharing options for video
-- Can we use videos for marketing / promotion? how do we get consent for this?

* How do we review / evaluate video to make sure it's not pornography, DMCA protected, etc.
-- We need DMCA takedown tools and process
-- 

* Put together details for video recording, storage, streaming solutions (who would we use?)

* What controls will the user have?

* Where and how will we display this info in the app and on the website?

* How would we give options to share to social media or other sources?

* Do we want to display videos to RDB-using employers?
